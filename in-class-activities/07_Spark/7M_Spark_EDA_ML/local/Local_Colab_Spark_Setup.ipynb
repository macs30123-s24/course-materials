        "You can also set up Spark locally in a similar way if you want to take advantage of multiple CPU cores (and/or GPU) on your laptop (the setup will vary slightly, though, depending on your operating system and you'll need to figure out these specifics on your own; however, this setup does work in WSL for me if I run the follow bash script in my terminal window using `sudo`). This being said, this local option should be for testing purposes on sample datasets only. If you want to run big PySpark jobs, you will want to run these in an EMR notebook (with an EMR cluster as your backend) or on the Midway Cluster.\n",
